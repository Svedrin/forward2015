# Let’s talk about

* “Systems Programming” 😅
* Rust
* Rust ❤ Node

# Systems Programming

“When it does actually matter” - @wycats

- Memory usage
- Speed
- Control

# Systems Programming

We’re all good at different things.

Some people think low-level is _easier_ than
web programming.

Rust (and its community) is here to help you.

# Rust

Rust is a systems language focused on three things:

* Safety
* Speed
* Concurrency

<pre><code>
Speed                          Safety
Danger                         Slow
Control                        No control

<----------------------------------->
  C                Java        Ruby
</code></pre>

# Rust

Rust breaks this tradeoff by using compile-time
checks to ensure safety, rather than runtime checks.

Tradeoff: fighting with the compiler 😅 

# Rust

Let’s look at some code!

# Ruby & Node

Node is great.

You don’t have to stop using Node to use Rust.

You can write Node packages in Rust!

# Thanks Forward!
